## AI Usage Disclosure
This project used Claude AI across multiple chat sessions for research assistance (identifying search strategies, understanding legal/financial terminology), data organization support (structuring findings, analysis frameworks), technical implementation (HTML scroll story, Tableau specifications, GitHub setup), and project documentation. While AI provided research guidance and technical assistance, all 22 primary sources were independently discovered and verified, all financial analysis and insights are original work, and all creative interpretations and business lessons are independent conclusions.

**Summary:** This represents genuine collaboration between human research skills and AI assistance tools, with full transparency about the collaborative process.
